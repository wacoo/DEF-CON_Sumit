<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION  -->

# 📖 DEFCON Conference Portal <a name="about-project"></a>

**DEFCON Conference Portal** is a webside developed to be a hub for any DEFCON conference related issues. 

DEFCON started as talks and parties that evolved into a community of those who with a hacker’s mindset and an insatiable curiosity of how things work. We are committed to creating a place for all hackers to share, interact and learn from each other. Sometimes, though, we have to reassess whether the structure of DEF CON is helping or hindering this vision.

One example of this is how we categorize creators. There are a lot of content departments at DEF CON. If you’re a Vendor, you go here. If you’re a Village, you go over there. If something doesn’t quite fit our categories we force them to fit: The EFF or a University in our vendor room for example.

With “Communities” we intend to work with some of the content creators that don’t fit perfectly into categories like "Village" or "Contest". We want to help them define the best way to showcase what they came to share without a prior template limiting their options. What would the EFF’s space look like if they didn’t have to try to fit in with Vendors? This is a good time to get together and figure it out.

This year at DEF CON you’ll see this new DEF CON Community format in action with DEF CON Groups (DCG), Women in Information Security Professionals (WISP), DEF CON Hackers with Disabilities (HDA), and some more as groups learn of this new option. Please make some time to visit them and check out their new offerings. As always, thank you for helping us grow and test out new things. See you soon.
